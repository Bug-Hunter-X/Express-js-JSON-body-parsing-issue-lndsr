# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The problem arises when the incoming request doesn't have the correct `Content-Type` header or is missing it entirely.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple Express.js application that expects a JSON payload in a POST request to `/user`. If a request is made without the `Content-Type: application/json` header (or with an incorrect header), the `req.body` will be empty, leading to unexpected behavior. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a fix by explicitly parsing the body using `express.json()`, ensuring that the request body is correctly handled even if the `Content-Type` header is missing or invalid. This middleware parses the JSON request body and makes it available as `req.body`.  The solution also includes more robust error handling.
